# Ensembler

## The Problem
Having an ensemble at a major event such as a wedding or gala has become a standard. However, such ensembles are not only difficult to schedule due to their high 
demand, but also ludicrously expensive, with many spending thousands to hire professional quartets who only play for a total of an hour. 
Such a high price is wholly unneccessary for the majority of such events, and takes away from the budget for other aspects of the venue that should matter more.


This issue came to me in high school, where people would call to our high school and ask for a quartet in either last-minute desperation or because they did not have the budget
for a professional quartet. Having played in a quartet at weddings and galas, I have seen how low the bar generally is for repetoire, as well as how almost nobody 
at these events are too concerned about the quality of the music itself.


On the flip side, many solo musicians would eagerly seek out such opportunities, but do not want to commit to establishing a quartet as it is expensive and difficult
to market. Such musicians are more than capable of playing at venues after two or three rehearsals.

## The Solution
With Ensembler, clients can post their events and find musicians nearby who are willing to take on the role. These musicians are verified by moderators through
an application process, and clients can also leave reviews. 

## Upcoming features include:
* OAuth with Facebook
* Simulated paywall or holding deposit (to ensure that clients are serious about their event before posting)
* Reviews for musicians
* Live updates with Socket.IO
* Admin role capable of banning users and approving applications
* Support for more types of ensembles or solo instruments
